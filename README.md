# GitHub
GitHub is the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub.

## What is a repository
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. You can discuss and manage your project's work within a repository. Check out the documentation to know how to create a repostory:  
https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github

## How to create an issue
Use GitHub Issues to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub. Have a look at the documentation to create your first issue:  
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue  
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues  
https://guides.github.com/features/issues/

## How to use Markdown : a simple and easy-to-use markup language
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. GitHub supports Markdown and uses a particular form of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown. You can check this "Getting started" article on GitHub:  
https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github

## Managing labels
You can manage your work on GitHub by creating labels to categorize issues, pull requests, and discussions. You can apply labels in the repository the label was created in. Once a label exists, you can use the label on any issue, pull request, or discussion within that repository. Get a first look at the documentation:  
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels

We highly suggest you to have a look at the Kubernetes project on GitHub to check how one of the most ever popular project uses labels, and learn how you can also use labels.

# ZenHub
ZenHub is a layer of agile project management tools that exists both within GitHub and directly through your browser. Developers can engage with project management in a comfortable environment, while non-technical team members have total visibility into the development process. ZenHub lets users easily move issues through pipelines on a Kanban board and organize complex projects into Epics. Have a look at the key differences between GitHub and ZenHub :  
https://blog.zenhub.com/zenhub-vs-github-projects-what-are-the-key-differences/

You can connect to ZenHub with your GitHub credentials through https://www.zenhub.com/ or via directly in GitHub with the browser extension.

ZenHub is **free** for open source project and on public repositories. It allows full access to all ZenHub’s features and functionalities.

## Workspace
A Workspace is how you keep issues in GitHub organized using ZenHub. You can add any number of GitHub repositories into the same ZenHub Workspace, letting your team benefit from a shared view of all your work. With ZenHub Workspaces, the same GitHub repository can be added to multiple Boards. This allows individual teams to work on the same set of issues but follow their own workflow and pipeline structure.

## Managing pipelines with the board
Pipelines are the columns of Kanban. When viewing the Board, you will see a collection of pipelines that represent the stages that work goes through within your team.

## Sprint planning
In Agile-Scrum, sprints are a fixed length of time (typically two weeks) during which an agreed-upon chunk of work is completed and ready to be shipped. ZenHub sprints allow teams to group issues together that will be completed within this timeframe.
